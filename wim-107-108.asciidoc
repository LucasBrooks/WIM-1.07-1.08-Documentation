== Sections

* WIM Header - 126 bytes, uncompressed
* File Resources - `Store`, `MSZIP`, `LZNT1` and `LZX` supported
* Metadata Resource - `.ini` format, same compression
* Lookup Table - File table/index, uncompressed
* XML Data - Not a critical section, uncompressed

== WIM Header

Defines the content of the `.wim` file, including memory location of key resources (file resources, lookup table, XML data), and various `.wim` file attributes (version, size, compression type).

== File Resources
A series of packages that contain captured data, such as source files. Generally `MSZIP` compressed `.cab` files mixed with small uncompressed files for early Longhorn WIMs.

== Metadata Resource
Contains information about the files that you are capturing, including directory structure and file attributes. There is one metadata resource for each image in a `.wim` file. Generally compressed plain text file, `.ini` format.
